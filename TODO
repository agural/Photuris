Here are the items that still need to be worked out:

* Updating README.md.
* Updating Makefile (needs correct port, FUSES, etc).
* Pulling out all auxiliary library functions to /lib.
* Merging in the bootloading tools (both initial loading of the bootloading
  files and allowing bootloading later on).
* Completing the /src/photuris.ino file.
